JLC have delivered and everything fits perfectly:

Looking good for getting a prototype working in the next few days. I have done a few revisions of the case and it is snapping together well enough. The only minor snag is that the case is currently modelled in On-Shape, which is convenient but not great for sharing - so need to move the design to FreeCAD (and learn FreeCAD).

In related news the ESP8266 support in confrm is working, which now opens up the ability to integrate with Tasmota.

I have also been looking at some changes to the overall design to push the price down. USB2 gives a significant saving, and using a MOSFET in place of the relay is an option. The MOSFET will waste some power and generate a little bit of heat.

Parts are on order for some testing.
