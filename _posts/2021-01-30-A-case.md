3D printer upgrade was on of this weekends tasks. My Ender 3 now has a 4.2.7 mainboard, with silent running - and the glass bed has been reinstated.

First print was the prototype for the usb switch case:

Fairly good result first go, bed adhesion wasn't the best so I may need to play with the fan settings or add a brim to keep the shells down.
